# Calibrating Dynamic Models


Examples from [Ed Balistreri](https://balistreri.createunl.com/dyncalib/dyncal.html)

The file `main.jl` has all the code to run the models. The files `scalar_data.jl` and `scalar_models.jl` contain the data structures and model definitions for the scalar models. 

Each function has a docstring that describes its purpose and usage. To see the docstring for any function or struct, type `?function_name` in the Julia REPL.

Additionally, I've added a `main_indexed.jl` file that includes code for working with a multi-sectoral model. The data and model definitions for this are in  `indexed_models.jl`.
